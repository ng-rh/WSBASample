	About this task</h4>

<div class="section">
<div class="p">There is one basic scenario and one intermediate
scenario in this sample.
<dl>
	<dt >Basic Scenario</dt>

	<dd>
	<p>The basic scenario demonstrates how WS-BA compensation handling
	can be used to generate an email notification when an email fails to be
	delivered due to a business exception error. You have the option to
	cause an exception error in order to test the configuration.</p>
	</dd>


	<dt >Intermediate Scenario</dt>

	<dd>
	<p>The intermediate scenario demonstrates how WS-BA compensation
	handling can be used when a process carries out two transactions.</p>
	<div class="p">The first transaction is booking a flight. There
	are two service providers for this transaction:
	<ul>
		<li>Flight Provider A</li>

		<li>Flight Provider B</li>

	</ul>
	If Flight Provider A returns an error, WS-BA compensation handling
	attempts to complete the booking by using Flight Provider B. If both
	Flight Providers return an error, a cancelation email is generated.</div>
	<div class="p">The second transaction is booking a hotel. There
	are two service providers for this transaction:
	<ul>
		<li>Hotel Provider A</li>

		<li>Hotel Provider B</li>

	</ul>
	If Hotel Provider A returns an error, WS-BA compensation handling
	attempts to complete the booking by using Hotel Provider B. If both
	Hotel Providers return an error, a cancelation email is generated.</div>
	<p>When both booking transactions are complete, the travel agent
	can decide not to confirm the booking. In this case, the transactions
	are rolled back and cancelation emails are generated for each booking.</p>
	<div class="p">There are four pre-configured setups and one
	custom setup for you to test:
	<dl>

		<dt class="dlterm">Preconfigured setup A</dt>

		<dd>In this setup Flight Provider A is unable to process the booking
        request. Instead, the application books the flight with Flight Provider
        B. It then books the hotel successfully with Hotel Provider A. This
        test shows how WS-BA support overcomes minor failure during transaction
        processing, by finding an alternative service provider when the first
        service provider has failed.</dd>


		<dt class="dlterm">Preconfigured setup B</dt>

		<dd>In this setup Flight Provider A produces an exception error, so
        the application books the flight with Flight Provider B. Hotel Provider
        A produces an exception error, so the application books the hotel
        with Hotel Provider B. This test shows how WS-BA support overcomes
        a minor failure during a business activity, by finding an alternative
        provider for booking the hotel, despite the fact that one transaction
       (booking the flight) has already been completed.</dd>


		<dt class="dlterm">Preconfigured setup C</dt>

		<dd>In this setup both flight providers and both hotel providers return
        errors and no transactions are completed. The application generates
        two cancelation emails detailing that no flight or hotel were booked.
        This setup shows the compensation handling aspect of WS-BA. When a
        transaction fails, the application compensates by generating a cancelation
        email, which can warn the appropriate person about the error.</dd>


		<dt class="dlterm">Preconfigured setup D</dt>

		<dd>In this setup, the application successfully books a flight with
        Flight Provider A and a hotel room with Hotel Provider A. However,
        the travel agent decides not to confirm the bookings, so the transactions
        are rolled back. The WS_BA compensation service cancels the flight
        and hotel bookings and generates two cancelation emails. This setup
        shows how WS-BA compensation handling can be used to roll back the
        work completed under two transactions after an input from an external
        source.</dd>

	</dl>
	<dl>
		<dt class="dlterm">Custom configuration</dt>

		<dd class="dldescription">In the custom configuration you can choose what parts of the
		system, if any, produce an error. You can also choose whether the
		travel agent confirms the booking or not. You can test the
		configuration and see how WS-BA compensates for any errors that occur.</dd>

		Configuring the WebSphere Application Server environment

		<span>To configure your WebSphere Application Server environment

		<ol>
				<li>Stop the application server.</li>

				<li>In the command-line, navigate to <samp><span
					class="keyword">profile_root</span>\bin</samp>. The <samp><span
					class="keyword">profile_root</span></samp> directory is the directory where
				you have installed your application server profile. For example: <samp>C:\Program
				Files\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\AppSrv01</samp>.</li>

				<li>Check whether the PATH environment variable includes <samp><span
					class="keyword">profile_root</samp>\bin</span>.
				<ul>
					<li>To see the contents of your PATH environment variable, enter
					<samp>set path</samp> into the command-line.</li>

					<li>If <samp>profile_root\bin</samp> is not listed in the PATH
					result, enter <samp>set path= profile_root\bin;%PATH%</samp> into the
					command-line. Specifying this tells the command line where the <samp>wsadmin.bat</samp>
					file is located, so that it can start wsadmin scripting.</li>

				</ul>
				</li>

				<li>Navigate to <samp>install_root\scripts</samp> in the
				command-line.</li>

				<li>Enter <samp>wsadmin.bat -conntype none -f
				setupWAS.jacl</samp> into the command-line. The <samp>setupWAS.jacl</samp>
				script completes the following actions:
				<ol type="a">
					<li>Creates a JDBC XA provider</li>

					<li>Creates a data source on the provider</li>

					<li>Enables the compensation service on the application server</li>

		Installing the sample</p>
		<span>To install the sample application, complete the following
steps:</span>
	<ol>
		<li>Enter <samp>wsadmin.bat -conntype none -f install.jacl</samp>
		into the wsadmin command line. The <samp>install.jacl</samp> script
		completes the following actions:
		<ol type="a">
			<li>Installs the WS-BA sample application: <samp>WSBASample.ear</samp>.</li>

			<li>Attaches the policy set created by <samp>setupWAS.jacl</samp>

	<p class="subsection">
		Rebuilding the sample</p>
	<span>If you need to tailor the application to work
	with your WebSphere Application Server environment, you can rebuild the
	sample application by completing the following steps:</span>
	<ol>
		<li>First make a backup copy the <samp><span
			class="keyword">install_root</span></samp> directory.</li>

		<li>Navigate to the <samp><span class="keyword">install_root</span>\src</samp>
		directory and rebuild the WS-BA sample EAR files.</li>

		<li>Check whether the PATH environment variable includes <samp><span
			class="keyword">profile_root</span>\bin</samp>.
		<ul>
			<li>To see the contents of your PATH environment variable, enter
			<samp>set path</samp> into the command-line.</li>

			<li>If <samp>profile_root\bin</samp> is not listed in the PATH
			result, enter <samp>set path= profile_root\bin;%PATH%</samp> into the
			command-line. Specifying this tells the command line where the <samp>wsadmin.bat</samp>
			file is located, so that it can start wsadmin scripting.</li>

		</ul>
		</li>

		<li>Navigate to <samp><span class="keyword">install_root</span>\scripts</samp>
		in the command-line interpreter.</li>

		<li>Enter the following wsadmin command: <samp><span
			class="keyword">install_root</span>\scripts\buildWSBASample.bat</samp>. The
		script sets the appropriate class path information and starts the Ant
		build utility. The Ant utility reads the <samp>build.xml</samp> files,
		which describe how to build the samples.</li>
